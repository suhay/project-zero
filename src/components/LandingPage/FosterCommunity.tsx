        <p>
          Even the smallest change can cause a massive impact, but you shouldnâ€™t
          have to go at it alone. Through shared resources and stories, we want
          to bring everyone together. We want to promote the little corner shops
          and local makers. Provide a space where people can ask questions and
          provide guidance to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are nurturing a platform where our local communities can thrive.
